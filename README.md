# scoria is not a replacement

this is stated in the wiki but i will say it again <span class="underline">scoria is not a replacement for your distros package manager</span>. so dont remove your distros package manager or things will break.

# About scoria

scoria is not going to have all of the programs. it will mainly have programs that can be compiled from source witch is most things. scoria was made to automate the process of compiling programs from source so you don&rsquo;t have to.
